# Predicting-Bitcoin-Price-Variations-using-Bayesian-Regression

Reference paper : http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1231.pdf

In this project, predicted the price variations of bitcoin, a virtual cryptographic currency.
Used machine learning technique, Bayesian Regression, and implemented this technique in Python.
The raw data used can be found here : http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/. Performed some cleaning on this raw data.
Then implemented the algorithm provided in the above mentioned reference paper
